Today I completed the OAuth integration for WorkLog AI using LinkedIn authentication. I successfully implemented the Passport.js strategy andconfigured the callback URLs. I also solved critical CSS compilation issues by upgrading from Tailwind v3 to v4 syntax. Additionally, I implemented background job processing for AI analysis and set up the Claude API integration for extracting insights from journal entries.
