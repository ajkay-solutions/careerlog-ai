| Service | Status | URL | Response Time |
|---------|--------|-----|---------------|

## Monitoring Configuration

### Keep-Alive Schedule
- **Peak Hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)**: Every 5 minutes
- **Off-Peak Hours**: Every 14 minutes
- **Weekends**: Every 14 minutes

### Why Keep-Alive?
Render.com's free tier services automatically spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. Our GitHub Actions workflow pings both services regularly to:
- âœ… Prevent cold starts for users
- âœ… Ensure consistent response times
- âœ… Monitor service health
- âœ… Detect issues early

### Service Endpoints

#### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl https://worklog-ai-backend.onrender.com/api/health
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T10:00:00.000Z",
  "services": {
    "database": {"status": "healthy"},
    "prismaOperations": {"status": "healthy", "counts": {...}}
  }
}
```

#### Frontend Health Check
```bash
curl https://worklog.ajkaysolutions.com
```

Expected: HTTP 200 with HTML content

## Manual Service Wake-Up

If services are sleeping, you can manually wake them:

1. **Via GitHub Actions**: 
   - Go to [Actions Tab](https://github.com/ajkay-solutions/worklog-ai/actions)
   - Select "Keep Render Services Alive" or "Service Health Monitor"
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Via Direct Access**:
   - Simply visit [WorkLog AI](https://worklog.ajkaysolutions.com)
   - The first load may take 30-50 seconds if services are sleeping

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Wake Up
1. Check Render dashboard for deployment status
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
4. Ensure database connections are healthy

### Slow Response Times
- First request after sleep: 30-50 seconds (normal)
- Subsequent requests: < 500ms (expected)
- If consistently slow, check Render metrics

## Cost Optimization

Current configuration stays within free tier limits:
- GitHub Actions: ~6,000 minutes/month used (out of 2,000 free)
- Estimated usage: ~300-400 minutes/month
- Well within free tier âœ…

## Alternative Solutions

If you need 100% uptime:

1. **UptimeRobot** (Free): External monitoring every 5 minutes
2. **Render Paid Tier** ($7/month): Never sleeps
3. **Cloudflare Workers**: Could create a lightweight keep-alive worker
4. **Better Stack** (Free tier): 10 monitors, 3-minute intervals
