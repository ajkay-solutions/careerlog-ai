# Google OAuth Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
Google OAuth was returning "404 - The OAuth client was not found" error.

## Root Cause
There was a **typo in the Google Client ID** in the WorkLog AI `.env` file.

### Incorrect (WorkLog AI had):
```
677875518045-8qa0q2msug0ngmgvkokc5s3somaooh0.apps.googleusercontent.com
                              ^^^^^ (missing 'v')
```

### Correct (Job Assistant uses):
```
677875518045-8qa0q2msug0ngmgvkvokc5s3somaooh0.apps.googleusercontent.com
                              ^^^^^^ (has 'v' in the middle)
```

## Fix Applied
Updated `/home/ajk/worklog-ai/backend/.env` with the correct Google Client ID that matches Job Assistant.

## Testing
The backend has been restarted with the correct configuration. You should now be able to:

1. Clear your browser cache/cookies
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Successfully authenticate with Google
5. Get redirected back to the application with a JWT token

## LinkedIn OAuth Status
LinkedIn OAuth continues to work correctly. The entry loading timeout issue has also been fixed by adding 15-second timeout protection to the database queries.

## Current Status
✅ Backend running on port 3004 with correct Google Client ID
✅ Frontend running on port 5173
✅ Google OAuth should now work correctly
✅ LinkedIn OAuth working
✅ Database queries protected with 15s timeout (fixed the loading issue)
