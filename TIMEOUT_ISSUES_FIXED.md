# Database Timeout Issues - RESOLVED âœ…

## Problem Summary
Users were experiencing "Request timeout (10s) - /api/entries" errors when trying to load entries, especially when multiple concurrent requests were being made.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Frontend timeout**: 10 seconds for entries
2. **Backend timeout**: Originally 15 seconds, but concurrent database operations were causing queries to queue up and exceed timeout
3. **No concurrency control**: Multiple database operations could run simultaneously, overwhelming the database connection pool

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Increased Timeout Values** âœ…
- **Backend**: 15s â†’ 30s for database operations
- **Frontend**: 10s â†’ 35s for entries endpoints (5s buffer over backend)
- **Other endpoints**: 10s â†’ 20s (general improvement)

### 2. **Database Connection Semaphore** âœ…
Created `/backend/src/services/databaseSemaphore.js`:
- **Limits concurrent database operations to 3**
- **Queues additional requests** when limit is reached
- **Prevents database connection pool exhaustion**
- **Provides status monitoring** for debugging

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling** âœ…
- **Better timeout error messages** with specific endpoint info
- **Semaphore status logging** for troubleshooting
- **Race condition protection** between timeout and actual queries

## Files Modified

### Backend:
1. `/backend/src/routes/entries.js`
   - Added database semaphore integration
   - Increased timeout from 15s to 30s
   - Added semaphore status logging

2. `/backend/src/services/databaseSemaphore.js` (NEW)
   - Implements concurrency control for database operations
   - Limits to 3 concurrent operations
   - Provides queuing mechanism

### Frontend:
1. `/frontend/src/services/api.js`
   - Increased entries timeout from 10s to 35s
   - Increased general timeout from 10s to 20s
   - Better timeout categorization by endpoint type

## How It Works Now

### Concurrency Control:
1. **Request arrives** for entry data
2. **Semaphore checks** if slot available (max 3)
3. **If available**: Execute immediately
4. **If busy**: Queue request until slot opens
5. **Execute in order** as slots become available

### Timeout Protection:
- **Frontend**: Waits up to 35s for entries
- **Backend**: Waits up to 30s for database operations
- **Buffer**: 5s safety margin between frontend/backend

### Load Balancing:
- **Maximum 3 concurrent** database operations
- **Automatic queuing** prevents connection exhaustion
- **Status monitoring** helps identify bottlenecks

## Expected Results

### Performance:
- âœ… **No more timeout errors** for normal operations
- âœ… **Smoother experience** during concurrent usage
- âœ… **Better database stability** under load
- âœ… **Predictable response times** even with multiple users

### Monitoring:
- Backend logs show semaphore status: `ðŸ“Š DB Semaphore status: { running: 2, queued: 1, maxConcurrent: 3 }`
- Timeout errors now specify 30s instead of 10s
- Better error context for debugging

## Testing Instructions

1. **Single User**: Should load entries normally (2-5 seconds)
2. **Multiple Tabs**: Open several tabs, navigate between dates
3. **Concurrent Requests**: Should queue properly instead of timing out
4. **Heavy Load**: Try rapid clicking - should be stable

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check semaphore logs** in backend console
2. **Look for "Database query timeout"** errors (now 30s instead of 15s)
3. **Monitor database connection** health endpoint: `/api/health`
4. **Verify frontend timeout** messages show 35s for entries

## Technical Details

### Semaphore Implementation:
```javascript
// Limits to 3 concurrent database operations
const dbSemaphore = new DatabaseSemaphore(3);

// Usage in entries route
const result = await dbSemaphore.acquire(async () => {
  return await cachedDbService.getCachedUserEntries(userId, date, queryFn);
});
```

### Timeout Chain:
```
Frontend (35s) â†’ Backend (30s) â†’ Database Operation
   â†‘              â†‘                 â†‘
   Buffer      Race Protection    Actual Query
```

The timeout issue should now be completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
