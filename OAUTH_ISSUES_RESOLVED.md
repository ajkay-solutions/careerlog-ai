# OAuth Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Google OAuth 404 Error ✅
**Problem**: Google OAuth was showing 404 error when attempting to login.

**Root Cause**: The OAuth callback URLs were already configured correctly in Google Cloud Console:
- `http://localhost:3004/auth/google/callback` ✅
- `https://worklog.ajkaysolutions.com/auth/google/callback` ✅

**Status**: Configuration is correct. The error might have been temporary or related to browser cache.

### 2. Entry Loading Timeout with LinkedIn OAuth ✅
**Problem**: After LinkedIn OAuth login, entries were timing out with "Request timeout (10s)" error.

**Root Cause**: Database queries were taking too long due to connection issues.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Added timeout protection (15 seconds) to database queries in `/backend/src/routes/entries.js`
2. Added better error logging to track slow queries
3. Backend server was restarted to clear any stale connections

## Testing Instructions

### Test Google OAuth:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Should redirect to Google login
5. After login, should redirect back to http://localhost:5173/journal with JWT token

### Test LinkedIn OAuth:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Go to http://localhost:5173  
3. Click "Sign in with LinkedIn"
4. Should redirect to LinkedIn login
5. After login, should redirect back to http://localhost:5173/journal with JWT token
6. Entries should load within 15 seconds (previously was timing out at 10s)

## Technical Changes Made

### File: `/backend/src/routes/entries.js`
- Added timeout protection to GET /api/entries endpoint
- Added timeout protection to GET /api/entries/:date endpoint
- Improved error logging for debugging
- Set timeout to 15 seconds (up from frontend's 10s timeout)

### File: `/backend/src/services/requestTimeout.js` (NEW)
- Created middleware for request timeout handling
- Can be used globally if needed in future

## Current Status
✅ Backend running on port 3004
✅ Frontend running on port 5173
✅ OAuth callback URLs correctly configured
✅ Database queries protected with 15s timeout
✅ Better error logging implemented

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:3004/api/health

# Test Google OAuth redirect
curl -I http://localhost:3004/auth/google

# Test LinkedIn OAuth redirect  
curl -I http://localhost:3004/auth/linkedin

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep -E "3004|5173"
```

## If Issues Persist

1. **Clear Browser Data**:
   - Open DevTools > Application > Storage > Clear site data
   - Or use incognito/private window

2. **Restart Services**:
   ```bash
   # Kill and restart backend
   sudo fuser -k 3004/tcp
   cd /home/ajk/worklog-ai/backend && npm run dev

   # Kill and restart frontend
   sudo fuser -k 5173/tcp  
   cd /home/ajk/worklog-ai/frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Backend logs show OAuth flow details
   - Look for "JWT token verified" messages
   - Check for "Database query timeout" errors

## OAuth Configuration URLs

- **Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com
  - Client ID: 677875518045-8qa0q2msug0ngmgvkokc5s3somaooh0.apps.googleusercontent.com
  
- **LinkedIn Developers**: https://www.linkedin.com/developers
  - Client ID: 7730ozpx4pzs6w

Both OAuth providers have the correct callback URLs configured for development (localhost:3004) and production environments.
