# Week 6 Production Deployment Checklist

## üöÄ WorkLog AI Production Launch Checklist

**Target**: Deploy WorkLog AI to production at `worklog.ajkaysolutions.com`  
**Timeline**: Week 6 of MVP development  
**Status**: Ready for deployment after Week 5 completion

---

## üìã Your Action Items (Required)

### 1. Domain Setup
- [ ] **Add DNS Record**
  - Record Type: `CNAME`
  - Name: `worklog`
  - Value: `[render-app-url]` (will provide after Render setup)
  - TTL: `300` (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Verify DNS Propagation** (use: https://dnschecker.org)

### 2. OAuth Production Callbacks

#### üö® **URGENT: Fix Google OAuth Development Setup First**
- [ ] **Google Cloud Console** - Fix Development Issue
  - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
  - Navigate to: APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
  - Find OAuth 2.0 Client ID: `677875518045-8qa0q2msug0ngmgvkokc5s3somaooh0.apps.googleusercontent.com`
  - **Add MISSING development callback to "Authorized redirect URIs":**
    - `http://localhost:3004/auth/google/callback` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING - CAUSES 404 ERROR**
  - **Add production callback:**
    - `https://worklog.ajkaysolutions.com/auth/google/callback`
  - Click "Save"
  
**Issue Found**: Google OAuth returns "invalid_client" error because `http://localhost:3004/auth/google/callback` is not in the authorized redirect URIs.

- [ ] **LinkedIn Developer Console**
  - Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/developers
  - Find App ID: `7730ozpx4pzs6w`
  - Navigate to: Auth tab
  - Add to "Authorized redirect URLs for your app":
    - `https://worklog.ajkaysolutions.com/auth/linkedin/callback`
  - Click "Update"

### 3. Render.com Account Setup
- [ ] **Create/Access Render Account**
  - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
  - Ensure you can create new services
  - Note: Free tier has limitations (spins down after 15min idle)

- [ ] **Consider Upgrade** (Optional but Recommended)
  - Upgrade to paid plan for:
    - No spin-down delays
    - Better performance
    - SSL certificate
    - Cost: ~$7-10/month

### 4. Production Environment Secrets
- [ ] **Generate New JWT Secrets**
  ```bash
  # Generate JWT_SECRET (256-bit)
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
  
  # Generate SESSION_SECRET
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
  ```
  - [ ] Copy and save these values securely

- [ ] **Gather Existing API Keys**
  - [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (from your Anthropic console)
  - [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (from Google Cloud Console)
  - [ ] `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` (from LinkedIn Developer)
  - [ ] `MAILGUN_API_KEY` (from Mailgun dashboard)

### 5. Database & Cache (Production Instances)
- [ ] **Supabase Production Database**
  - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
  - Create new project or use existing
  - Get connection strings:
    - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (connection pooling)
    - [ ] `DIRECT_URL` (direct connection)

- [ ] **Upstash Redis Production**
  - Go to: https://console.upstash.com
  - Create new Redis database or use existing
  - Get connection string:
    - [ ] `REDIS_URL`
